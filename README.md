# CST438-A2-Code-Review
By: Joshua Rivera

This assignment requires us to write a program to accomplish a series of
tasks, and create a pull request to merge our repository with the repository of a peer.
Then we will conduct a code review on a peer's implementation of the program to complete the pull request.
The main purpose of this assignment is to practice getting familiar with code reviews in the development 
process.
